BinaryTree
==========

This is a simple library of Binary Tree, which implements commonly used binary tree operations, including building binary tree, tree traversal, tree comparison, sum of path and cycle detection.

For more information about the code, please refer to `BinaryTree.h` and my blog: 

1. http://bo-yang.github.io/2014/05/26/binary-tree-traversal/.
2. http://bo-yang.github.io/2014/08/16/binary-tree-ii/.

To build the code, use command:

	g++ -std=c++11 -o <test> BinaryTree.h <test_file>.cc
